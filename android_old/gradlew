#
#   Gradle start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh is
#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or
#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole
#       command line, like:
#
#           ksh Gradle
#
#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script
#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:
#         * functions;
#         * expansions «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}», «${var+SET}»,
#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;
#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;
#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».
#
#   Important for patching:
#
#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided
#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.
#
#       The "traditional" practice of packing multiple parameters into a
#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security
#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating
#       options in "$@", and eventually passing that to Java.
#
#       Where the inherited environment variables (DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS,
#       and GRADLE_OPTS) rely on word-splitting, this is performed explicitly;
#       see the in-line comments for details.
#
#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,
#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.
#
#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template
#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/subprojects/plugins/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt
#       within the Gradle project.
